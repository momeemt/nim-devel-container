[![Publish Docker image](https://github.com/momeemt/nim-devel-container/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/momeemt/nim-devel-container/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This is a Dockerfile for a container running a development version of Nim on amd64 ubuntu using choosenim.
It is intended to be used for experimental purposes and I am not aware of any problems that may arise when developing.
